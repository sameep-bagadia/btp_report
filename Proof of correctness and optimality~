1) Correctness
We need to prove that a source and sink can never lie in the same partition.

Proof:
Suppose there exists a source u and sink v that lie in the same partition.
Consider the dependence distance between them to be d.
Thus v = u + d
Consider d' <= d and d' belongs S

Lemma: There always exists such d'
[
If d belongs S then d = d'
else as d was removed from the set of dependence distances, there must exist another dependence distance dominating d.
]

v' = u + d'
u, v' are another source sink pair

Lemma: If u, v lie in same partition then u and v' also
[
Let u,v lie in P(A,B)
Therefore, there exists a belongs A , a <= u
As a <= u <= v', a <= v'

Suppose v' does not belong to P.
Then there exists b belongs B, b <= v'
d' <= d
d' + u <= d + u
v' <= v 
Thus, b <= v' <= v 
thus, b <= v
which implies that v does not belong to P. Therefore our assumption is false. 
v' belongs to P
]

As, u, v' belong P(A,B)
there exists a belongs A, st a <= u
by the way in whcih partitions are created,
there exists b belongs B, st b <= a + d'
a <= u
a + d' <= u + d'
b <= a + d' <= v'
b <= v'
Thus it implies v does not belongs to P(A,B) which is a contradiction.

Thus, our assumption is false. There exists no u, v belonging to same partition.




2) OPTIMALITY
Even if a single iteration point from the next partition is added to this partition, it will lead to both source and sink belonging to same partition.

Suppose the partitions we created are not optimal.
Therefore there exists a point y which is in the next partition of P(A,B) which can be added to P(A,B). i.e it has no source in P(A,B).

As y is not in P(A,B), there exists b belongs B, b <= y
By the way in which partitions are created, there exists d belongs P and a belongs A, a + d = b
Let x = y - d
As b <= y, b - d <= y - d
a <= x
This means that x belongs to partition P(A,B)
x and y form a source-sink pair. Therefore is a source of y in P(A,B).
Therefore our assumption is false.

Thus partitions thus created are optimal.

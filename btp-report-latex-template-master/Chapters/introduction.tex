\chapter{Introduction}


A parallelizing compiler converts a sequential program to a semantically equivalent parallel program. For this transformation to be correct, data dependences must be satisfied. Therefore, data dependence analysis is done. There are various tests for data dependence like GCD test, Banerjee test, Delta test etc.~\cite{allenoptimizing}\\

A data dependence graph (DDG) is a directed graph with each statement as a vertex and an edge from statement $S_i$ to $S_j$ if there is a dependence $S_i \Delta S_j$. \\

Based on the DDG, transformations are applied to the sequential code. There are many transformations like loop fusion, loop skewing, loop interchange etc.~\cite{allenoptimizing}. But most of these transformations work only when the data dependences do not form a cycle. In the case when there is a cyclic dependence straightforward parallelization cannot be done. In such cases, cycle shrinking algorithm can be used.\\

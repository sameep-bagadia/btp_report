\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

For the constant dependence distance case, we have given the algorithm to generate the optimal partitions possible and for the variable dependence distance case also we have shown that the algorithm generates the optimal number of partitions theoretically. These can be taken up further in order to realise this on an architecture and actually make use of optimal partitions. \\

The complete algorithm can be implemented. A testing platform can be created and the algorithm can be put to test so as to have performance analysis of the algorithm. \\

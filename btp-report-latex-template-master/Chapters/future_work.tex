\chapter{Future Work}
We have given an algorithm to find the sets of points that can determine the optimal partitions. We have also implemented the algorithm to generate these sets. But the task of actually creating the partitions in the form of loops is yet to be done. This should be the next step which will complete this algorithm. \\

After this, the complete algorithm can be implemented. A testing platform can be created and the algorithm can be put to test so as to have performance analysis of the algorithm. \\

We have given an optimal algorithm for constant dependence distance case. But there is a lot to be done in variable dependence distance case. Similar idea can be applied in variable distance case also to get improvement. \\

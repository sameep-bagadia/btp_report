\chapter{Loop Generation Algorithm}
We have given an algorithm to find the sets of points that can determine the optimal partitions. Now we give an algorithm to generate actual loops given these sets of points. \\

\section{Notation}

generate\_loop() takes two sets of points A and B as input and outputs the loops representing P(A, B) \\

A, B are ordered sets of points. The ordering is based on ascending order of first dimension of the points. A.first() gives the first point in the ordered set A. Point is a vector of indices. \\

A.insert(a) inserts the point a in the ordered set A. A.remove() removes the first point from set A. \\

remove\_first(a) removes the first dimension from the vector. For example, remove\_first([1,2,3,4]) returns [2,3,4]. \\

dominate(A) removes redundant points from A. All points in set A that are dominated by some other point in A are removed from A. i.e., \\
if ($a,b \in A$ and $a \preceq b$) then b is removed from A. \\

boundaries is a vector of upper bound of loop indices.\\

l denotes the current loop nest level. It should be initially called with 0. \\

\section{Example}

Consider the following example: \\
DO I = 0 to 9 \\
\indent DO J = 0 to 9 \\
\indent \indent DO K = 0 to 9 \\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\} \\
\indent \indent ENDO \\
\indent ENDO \\
ENDO \\

\noindent In this case, boundaries = (9, 9, 9) \\
Let A = \{(1, 4, 1), (5, 1, 3)\} and B = \{(4, 6, 7), (7, 2, 5)\} \\

\noindent generate\_loop(A, B, boundaries, 0) generates the following code: \\

\noindent PARBEGIN \\
FORALL I = 1 to 3\\
\indent PARBEGIN\\
\indent FORALL J = 4 to 9\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 1 to 9\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\}\\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent PAREND\\
ENDALL\\
FORALL I = 4 to 4\\
\indent PARBEGIN\\
\indent FORALL J = 4 to 5\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 1 to 9\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\}\\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent FORALL J = 6 to 9\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 1 to 6\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\} \\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent PAREND\\
ENDALL\\
FORALL I = 5 to 6 \\
\indent PARBEGIN\\
\indent FORALL J = 1 to 3\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 3 to 9\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\}\\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent FORALL J = 4 to 5\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 1 to 9\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\}\\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent FORALL J = 6 to 9\\
\indent \indent FORALL K = 1 to 6\\
\indent \indent \indent \{Block of statements\}\\
\indent \indent ENDALL\\
\indent ENDALL\\
\indent PAREND\\
ENDALL\\
FORALL I = 7 to 9\\
\indent PARBEGIN\\
\indent FORALL J = 1 to 1\\

\section{Proof of Correctness}

\subsection{Notation}

[a:b] denotes the vector obtained on inserting element a at front of vector b.
For example [1:(2, 3, 4)] denotes (1, 2, 3, 4)

\subsection{Lemma1}
$(a > b) \implies (\forall x, \forall y, not([a:x] \preceq [b:y]))$\\
Proof is straightforward from definition of $\preceq$\\

\subsection{Lemma2}
{$(a \preceq b$ and $x \leq y) \implies ([x:a] \preceq [y:b])$\\
Proof is straightforward from definition of $\preceq$\\

\subsection{Lemma3}
$(not(a \preceq b)) \implies (\forall x,\forall y, not([x:a] \preceq [y:b]))$\\
Proof is straightforward from definition of $\preceq$\\

\subsection{Proof}

We need to prove that the set of points in P(A, B) and those generated by this algorithm are same. \\
Here $P(A,B) = \{x | ( \exists a \in A, a \preceq x) and (\forall b \in B, not(b \preceq x))\}$ \\

The proof is based on induction on the dimension of the points.\\

\noindent \textbf{Base case (dimension = 1)}:\\

When dimension is one, there can be exactly one point (say a) in set A and at most one point (say b) in B after removing redundant points. Thus, P(A, B) contains iteration points from a to b-1 when b exists. Otherwise it contains iteration points from a to boundary. The same iteration points are included by the algorithm also. Thus base case is proved.\\

\noindent \textbf{Induction case (dimension = k)}:\\

\noindent For each value of x, \\
$\forall a \in A, (first(a) > x) \implies (\forall y, not(a \preceq [x:y]))$ (By Lemma1). \\
Therefore those a where $first(a) > x$ need not be considered.\\

\noindent We have $A' = \{a \in A | first(a) \leq x\}$.\\
By induction the partition will include those y where $\exists a' \in A'$ such that $a' \preceq y$\\

\noindent $(\forall a$ such that its corresponding $a' \in A', first(a) \leq x$ and $\exists a' \in A', a' \preceq y) \implies (\exists a \in A, a \preceq [x:y])$ (by Lemma2).\\

\noindent $\forall b \in B, (first(b) > x) \implies (\forall y, not(b \preceq [x:y]))$ (by Lemma1).\\
Therefore, those b where $first(b) > x$ satisfy the condition and need not be considered.\\

\noindent $B' = \{b \in B | first(b) <= x\}$. \\
By induction, it will include only those points y where $\forall b' \in B',  not(y \preceq b')$ \\

\noindent $ not(y \preceq b') \implies not([x:y] \preceq [first(b):b'])$ (by Lemma 3). \\

\noindent Thus, $\forall b \in B, not([x:y] \preceq b)$.\\

Thus, we have included those iteration points [x:y] where $\exists a \in A, a \preceq [x:y]$ and $\forall b \in B, not(b \preceq [x:y])$. Thus, all the points included by the algorithm is same as the set of points defined by P(A,B).\\

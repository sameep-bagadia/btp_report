\chapter*{Abstract}
In this report we present an optimal algorithm for cycle shrinking transformation for parallelizing compilers. We first give a motivation for a better algorithm by pointing out that the extended cycle shrinking algorithm is not optimal when there is no dominating dependence distance. Then we give our algorithm to generate the partitions in the iteration space of loops in constant dependence distance case. We prove the correctness and optimality of our approach. We also give a method to calculate the number of partitions that our algorithm will generate without actually creating the partitions. We then proceed to give an algorithm to generate loops from the partitions we created. We also prove the correctness of this algorithm. Then we consider the variable dependence distance case and give a better algorithm than extended cycle shrinking algorithm. We also prove that the number of partitions generated by our algorithm is optimal. We also give some ideas for parallelizing our algorithm.

\chapter*{Abstract}
In this report we present an algorithm for cycle shrinking transformation for parallelizing compilers when the dependence distances are constant. We first give a motivation for a better algorithm by pointing out that the extended cycle shrinking algorithm is not optimal when there is no dominating dependence distance. Then we give our algorithm to generate the partitions in the iteration space of loops. We prove the correctness and optimality of our approach in case of constant dependence distances. We also give a method to calculate the number of partitions that our algorithm will generate without actually creating the partitions.

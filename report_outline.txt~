Extending Cycle Shrinking Transformation for Constant Distances
1. Abstract
2. Introduction (cycle shrinking algorithm for constant distances)
3. Intuition of possible optimization
4. Algorithm for generating points that represent partitions in the iteration space
5. Proof of correctness (source and sink never lie in same partition)
6. Proof of optimality (partition created is maximal and even if single iteration point is added to the partition, then at least one source-sink pair belongs to same partition)
7. Method to find the number of partitions required.
8. Construct the iteration space of a partition in terms of for-all loops from the set of points that represent the partition (only if time permits. the algorithm is not yet done)
9. Conclusion / Future Work

Dominating reference pairs:
A reference pair Ri dominates another reference pair Rj if 3 cases actually phi_k(R_i) <= phi_k(R_j) for all k
A reference pair R_i is called dominating reference pair if it dominates all other reference pairs in the loop.

A loop that doesn't have dominating reference pair will not be partitioned in an optimal way by the cycle shrinking algorithm.
Consider example

Thus there is a better method for partition. We will give a method to capture that paritioning

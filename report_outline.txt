Extending Cycle Shrinking Transformation for Constant Distances
Abstract
Introduction (cycle shrinking algorithm for constant distances)
Intuition of possible optimization
Representing a partition of the iteration space by a set of points (notation)
Algorithm for generating these points that represent partitions
Proof of correctness (source and sink never lie in same partition)
Proof of optimality (partition created is maximal. Even if single iteration point is added to the partition, then at least one source-sink pair belongs to same partition)
Method to find the number of partitions required. (without actually creating the partitions)
Construct the iteration space of a partition in terms of for-all loops from the set of points that represent the partition (only if time permits. the algorithm is not yet done)
Conclusion / Future Work
